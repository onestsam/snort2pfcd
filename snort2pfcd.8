.Sh NAME
.Nm snort2pfcd
.Nd provides real-time blocking of ip addresses from snort alerts via the packet filter firewall for a specified period of time.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm snort2pfcd
.Op Fl e Ar External Interface
.Op Fl w Ar WhiteListFile
.Op Fl l Ar LogFile
.Op Fl a Ar AlertFile
.Op Fl t Ar Seconds (to block an ip address)
.Op Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
analyzes snort alert output and blocks ip addresses using pf for a specified
period of time. Expiration of entries use Henrik Gustafsson's expiretable 
functions. A whitelist is specified to exclude local and trusted ip address 
from being blocked. Whitelist entries can be single ip addressess or blocks 
of addresses in CIDR format (255.255.255.255/32). This program is based on 
snort2c written by Antonio Benojar which was based on the original snort2pf 
perl script written by Stephan Schmieder.
.Pp
While
.Nm
will parse the default snort alert file, this can produce less than real-time 
blocking given the burden being placed on snort especially over an active, fast 
or low latency connection. Would strongly recommend using a spooler like barnyard2
to output the text alerts from the snort unified2 binary output.
.Pp
By default, the user-supplied whitelist is prepended with the addresses of all of 
the local interfaces as the handling of these addresses are usually specified by 
more complex pf rules and simply blocking these addresses can cause problems with 
certain configurations.
.Pp
The user-supplied whitelist can also be prepended with the address of the external 
interface only for paranoid configurations. Lo0 is always whitelisted.
.Pp
.Nm
also automatically whitelists addresses found within the /etc/resolv.conf file as these
addresses should also be handled by specific pf rules.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e Ar External Interface
external interface e.g. eth0 or "all" to whitelist all interfaces, default is to whitelist all interfaces
.It Fl w Ar WhiteListFile
whitelist file, default is /usr/local/etc/snort/rules/iplists/default.whitelist.
.It Fl l Ar LogFile
log file, default is /var/log/snort2pfcd.log.
.It Fl a Ar AlertFile
snort alert file, default is /var/log/snort/alert.
.It Fl t Ar Seconds (to block an ip address)
default is 60*60*3 or 3 hours.
.It Fl h
Show help.
